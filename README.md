# Maze
I worked on this project when first learning path-finding algorithms early on in my software development career.

This is a Breadth-First Search to find the shortest path between two pixels in a maze image. We traverse the maze by converting it into a binary array, and then creating an unweighted, bi-directional graph out of this array. We can then traverse this graph with our search algorithm.
